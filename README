nginx-mobwrite is a plugin that enables the nginx web server to
serve as a proxy for the Mobwrite daemon.

1. Basic concepts

The Mobwrite daemon is a Python application that listens on a dedicated
TCP port (3017 by default) for messages in its own lightweight format.

On the browser side, the Mobwrite JavaScript client sends requests to the
server by encapsulating Mobwrite messages in the body of an HTTP POST.
Thus a Mobwrite server requires a proxy that can receive HTTP requests
from clients, extract the messages embedded therein, and send them to
the Mobwrite daemon.  On the response side, similarly, the proxy receives
a reply from the Mobwrite daemon and must wrap it in an HTTP response to
send back to the browser.

Mobwrite has PHP, Python, and JSP implementations of the glue code needed
to make a web server act as a proxy for the Mobwrite daemon.  Although is
possible to add support for any of those languages to nginx via a helper
process, I wanted something operationally simpler, with no additional
moving parts.  Thus I made nginx-mobwrite, a plugin written in C that runs
within the nginx worker process's address space and uses nginx's built-in
upstream event-loop framework to talk to the Mobwrite daemon asynchronously.


2. Installation

Please see the INSTALL file at the root of the nginx-mobwrite source
directory for detailed installation and configuration instructions.
