To install the nginx-mobwrite plugin, you will need to rebuild nginx
from source.  To do this,

1. Download nginx-mobwrite and unpack it into some directory
2. Download the source code for nginx (v0.7.63 or later recommended)
   and unpack it into some other directory.
3. cd /path/where/you/installed/nginx
4. ./configure --prefix=/wherever/you/want/to/install/nginx \
   --add-module=/path/to/the/unpacked/nginx-mobwrite/source/directory
5. make
6. make install
   (Or "sudo make install" if you are installing to a target
   directory that requires root permissions.)

7. Edit your newly installed nginx.conf file to tell nginx
   what URI path(s) to proxy to the Mobwrite daemon.  For example,

     # many standard nginx settings omitted for brevity ...
     http {

         server {
             listen 80;
             # many standard server-level settings omitted...

             # Serve up static content by default
             location / {
                 root html;
                 index index.html;
             }

             # Upon receiving a request for the path /mw,
             # proxy it to the Mobwrite daemon at the
             # specified hostname:port
             location /mw {
                 mobwrite_pass localhost:3017;
             }
         }
     }
